# Use this Dockerfile when deploying the FULL version (real sentence-transformers
# embeddings) to a host with more memory than Render's free tier -- e.g.
# Hugging Face Spaces (Docker SDK, free CPU tier has ~16GB RAM) or Railway.
#
# For Render's free tier, skip this file entirely and use requirements.txt
# (TF-IDF only) with the native Python buildpack instead -- see README.md.
